## Overview and Origin

### [Zip Co Ltd](https://zip.co/au)
* The company Zip Money Ltd was incorporated in 2013 by two founders Larry Diamond and Peter Gray.
* In December of 2017 Zip Money Ltd changed its name to what it is today Zip Co Ltd, now days Zip Pay is more commonly known as Zip.
* Larry and Peters' concept of Zip was formulated on the idea of disrupting the world of credit cards. Both coming from a finance background their view about payment volumes in credit cards was extraordianarily large.  In Australia alone to the tune of about a $1 trillion per annum.
* The initial funding for Zip came in the form of an IPO (Initial Public Offering) raising a total of $5M in 2015.  Since then eight rounds of capital funding have taken place and raised a total of $893.6M.
* Zip were able to fund its customers loans through pooled, senior-secured loan notes from unrelated third party lenders with up to 12 month repayment terms.  In the beginning its funding facility was $5M.  It is substantially a lot more today.

## Business Activities:
* What specific financial problem is Zip trying to solve?
    
    Zip simplifies how you pay everywhere and save every day by offering fast, fair and seamless payment solutions online and in-store.
* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    
    Zip's customer base is two fold in that it provides companies a platform to partner with them and the consumer which is the Gen  Z and Millennials typically slightly older, slightly more financially savvy than users of other BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) services.  Zip customers use the service to purchase everyday items, such as groceries and petrol.
The size of the BNPL market in Australia alone is over 6 million users with a value of approximately $10B, this statistic is a drop in the ocean compared globally.
* What solutions does Zip offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    Zip's (or all BNPL) major competitors are the banks, more specifically credit cards, what Zip offers is intrest free credit and almost instant access to apply for that credit.
An advantage over other BNPL's is that Zip also has a feature that allows users to use its services with any retailer, not just registered merchants (sounds a bit like a credit card to me!).
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?
    
    Zip's platform is entirely digital and leverages big data in its proprietary fraud and credit-decisioning technology to deliver real-time responses.  

## Landscape:
* What domain of the financial industry is Zip in?

    Zip is a leading player in the digital retail finance and payments industry.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

    The major trends have been the disruption in finance where the younger generations are ditching credit cards for a more user-friendly option. As you can see, about 5 years ago the demise of credit cards had begun!

## Recommendations:
* If I were to advise Zip, what products or services would you suggest they offer?

    I would suggest they offer an option to allow credit to be given to buy Crypto currency.  On top of this offer a digital crypto trading platform.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit Zip?

    In the current climate with so much emphasis on the crypto and blockchain market and being in the age demographic of the main adoptors of this technology, Zip's customer base would likely take this on to get involved in this market. eg. Buy Crypto NOW, pay it off later!

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    Zip would need to adopt a new platform for the update, use a secure blockchain to operate a Zip wallet for secure storage of coins.  Utilize an App for ease of purchase. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

    These technologies would potentially add a whole new business model to Zip.  They would need these technologies to develop a fully encompassed trading platform.
